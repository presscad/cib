## Interface Class

In C++ there can be different definition of an interface class depending upon whom you ask. But, in context of CIB the interface class is defined as a class that has at least one virtual function and there is a way for library to call virtual function of a class implemented by it's client. Basically, if library can call a function implemented by client then the class to which that function belongs is an interface class.

This example is to demonstrate how CIB makes it possible to let client implement interface provided by library in an ABI stable way.

Let's consider the following example:
!INCLUDECODE "examples/060-simple-interface-class/pub/example.h" (c++)
