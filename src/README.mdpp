# CIB

**In a nutshell CIB is the answer to the problem for which C is used for exporting APIs of an application/library even when the application/library itself uses C++ for most of its implementation. C++ is great in expressing API but compiler generated ABI makes it difficult to use to publish compiler independent and ABI stable SDK.**

# Abstract
*C++ components are not ABI compatible and achieving ABI stability is very difficult. Programmers use C for exporting APIs that can be called from across component boundary. ABI compatibility and stability problem of C++ is what makes programmer resort to use of C when it comes to exporting API.
There are some proposals about standard C++ ABI, like [Itanium C++ ABI](http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/), that if used by all compilers and that does not change based on compiler switch, will make it possible to have ABI compatible C++ components. But that will still not make components ABI stable.*

## Jargon
1. **ABI Compatibility**: Compatibility of binary C++ components even when they are built with different compilers.
2. **API Stability**: Ability to compile client of a library with newer SDK headers without any change.
3. **ABI Stability**: Ability of binary component to work with newer version of another component without recompiling. Example of ABI stability is the ability of plugin (in binary form) of an application to seemlessly work with newer application.

# Overview
 CIB is an architecture to make it possible to publish compiler independent and ABI stable C++ library.
 This project is also about a tool that implements `cib architecture` for a given library headers.
 CIB architecture allows one binary component to use classes and functions defined in another binary component that may be built using different compiler. CIB architecture also ensures ABI stability between binary components
CIB can also be used as plugin architecture of application.

_In this document the binary component that exposes its classes will be called **Library**, a library can be an executable or a **DLL/SO**. The component that is compiled using SDK of the library will be called client of that library._

**Please note that CIB is an architecture that can be implemented using hand written code. It is just that it can be tedious to do that for large scale project and so we may need a tool. This project is for describing what excatly is CIB architecture and also for developing a tool that implements it.**
 
# CIB Features
- **ABI Compatibility** aka Compiler Independence: Library and clients can use their own choice of compilers.
- **ABI Stability**: Clients don't need to recompile with new headers unless an existing function is removed.
- **Forward Compatibility**: Newer clients can work with older library. _Some precautions is needed by both library and client for this._
- **ABI Resilience**: Virtual functions can be reordered in SDK without breaking ABI stability. With CIB there are other cases of ABI resilience too.
- **Perfect Isolation**: Clients can use library provided classes without access to original complete definition of library classes.

**CIB  allows client of a library to use all exported classes, as if those classes are part of the client code itself, without exposing the internals of classes.**

# CIB Goals
- Solution should be platform and compiler agnostic.
- Client that is written using traditional linking with library can easily migrate to **CIB**. This requires that CIB should be designed in such a way that it should not have any footprint in the code of client as well as library. There will of course be a small boiler plate code on both side but that's about it, the rest of the code should remain aloof about existence of CIB.

# Other Solutions
I have come across some solutions that try to solve the same problem but none of them is good enough. Some wants you to write separate layer on top of existing classes so that vtable is exported across component boundary in a portable manner or some exploits how compiler behaves and uses hacks to achieve goals or some is too specific to the project it was developed for.

- **CppComponent**: It basically uses hand written vtable to solve ABI problem. It looks like a clone of COM without idl. More details can be found here: https://github.com/jbandela/cppcomponents.
- **DynObj**: It exploits how compiler implements vtable. For details here: http://dynobj.sourceforge.net.
- **Libcef's translator**: Its a python script that parses C++ headers to produce automatic C layer for client and library. But it is too much specific to libcef and cannot be used in other project.

**And none of these solutions I am aware of are for ABI stability, they only target ABI compatibility for different compilers.** This is my understanding, of course I can be wrong.

# What is ABI
It may appear, in this document, I am late in defining `what is ABI`. We programmers do have some understanding about `ABI`. The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) also has a page for ABI. But I want to add another perspective about what exactly is ABI. **An ABI of a component is implementation details of features of the language in which the component is developed.** And this implementation detail depends on the compiler. For example, for a C++ component, we see mangled function names at binary level. The reason for that is C++ allows function overloading and compilers use name mangling to implement function overloading language feature of C++. In the same way all the implementation detail of other features of C++, like inheritance, encapsulation, runtime polymorphism, etc. end up being the ABI itself.

# Why C++ has ABI compatibity and stability issues
Actually even C has this problem, it's just another matter that it is relatively easier to achieve ABI compatibility and stability in C.
Things that can cause ABI compatibility and stability issues in C++ are:
1. Object layout.
2. Function calling convention.
3. Allocators and deallocators.
4. Underlying integer size of `enum`.
5. Size of various integer types.
6. Mangled function name.
7. Virtual function table.
8. RTTI.
9. Exceptions.
10. Inheritance.

**_If you are reading this and think there are more reasons for ABI problem then please create a pull request._**

As we can see first 5 can also be problems in C. But if we ensure same struct packing, same function calling convention across component boundary, use of same allocator and deallocator for both components, ensure same underlying integer type for enum, and ensure to use same size for integers that cross component boundary then that's all it takes to ensure ABI compatibility for C programs. Achieving ABI stability too is simpler in C. We just need to ensure that new members in struct should be only added at the end and there should be a way to detect different version of struct. The `size` or `version` member in many struct are just for that purpose. Of course that's not the only thing but the other things are damn easy, like not to remove existing function, or not change parameter type, etc. if we want to maintain ABI stability.
For C++, problems start with name mangling, that's the first reason of misunderstanding that can happen between 2 components. Layout for C++ objects are far more complex than C. There can be different layout for virtual tables depending upon compiler. Same goes for RTTI and exception. So, ensuring ABI compatibility is hard in C++. Ensuring ABI stability is super hard in general.
**One thing to note is that maintaining ABI compatibility and stability in C is largely a responsibility of library developers.** Unfortunately that is not going to change even when CIB is used. But goal of CIB is to make it an easy and achievable to ensure ABI stability in C++.

# ABI Resilience
Some changes are conceptually unimportant for clients of a library but they break binary compatiblity. CIB makes client resilient against such changes and so client and library remain binary compatible even when such changes are made. Below is a list of changes that don't affect compatibility of client and library if SDK is published using CIB:
- Any change in internal data member of a class.
- Addition of new virtual methods anywhere in the class.
- Change in order of virtual functions of a class.
- Change in inheritance that doesn't violate previous is-a relationship. For example:
    - if a class starts deriving from one more base class without removing previous base class.
    - if a class changes it's base class to another derived class of it's previous base class.
    - inheritance type is changed to/from `virtual` inheritance.
- Change in `inline`ness of a function. For CIB generated SDKs all inline functions are basically non-inlined and so it doesn't make any difference if `inline`ness of a function is changed.

# CIB Architecture

## Core architecture concept
Because language feature implementations end up being ABI, see [What is ABI](#what-is-abi), CIB provides different implementation of language features at component boundary. So, the core of CIB architecture is to implement C++ language features differently at componenet boundary in such a way that the ABI can be guaranteed to bo compatible and easier to ensure stability.

## High level architecture
The high level architecture is that there will be thin layers added to both Library and Client. These layers will have code to ensure ABI compatible communication between the two layers. These layers will communicate with their corresponding component in usual way because they will always be compiled together and so no special things need to be done. Graphically it can be depicted as:

![Integration architecture produced by CIB](img/cib_design.png "Integration architecture produced by CIB ")

### Library Side Glue Code
The code that forms library side layer is called **library side glue code**. This layer contains the code to represent class as set of free functions. These free functions for a class are bundled together in an array. This array of pointers-to-free-functions is called **MethodTable**. To avoid name mangling done by compilers that ruin the ABI compatibility, the library needs to export the MethodTable instead.

### Client Side Glue Code
The code that forms client side layer is called **client side glue code**. This layer contains the code to reconstruct the class back from the MethodTable exported by library.

### ABI Compatibility
Since no C++ functions or objects are exported by library there is no problem of ABI compatibility. Anything that is exported by library is MethodTable which can be exported using `extern "C"` and so name mangling doesn't come into play.

### ABI Stability
Since only thing that is shared between client and library is MethodTable maintaining it's stability ensures ABI stability across releases.

## CIB Architecture Elements

 Following are the broad elements of CIB architecture:

- CIB architecture needs two sets of files that are created based on public headers that library wants to publish.
- One set of files, that is called library side glue code, should be compiled with the library.
- The other set should be used by the client of the library. This is client side glue code.
- Library side glue code defines free C style functions for all functions including class methods, constructors, and destructors.
- For non-static method of class the corresponding C function has aditional parameter which is pointer to class.
- Implementation of such C functions are just to delegate the call to original function/method/constructor/destructor/etc.
- All C functions are assigned an integer value as its ID. This ID for a function will remain same across releases.
- For every class/struct/union/namespace a **MethodTable** is defined which is basically an array of function pointers.
- Library side glue code exports a C function that returns **MethodTable** for given class/struct/union/namespace ID.
- Class definitions for client is generated with same class-name but without any data member other than an opaque pointer to original class defined by library. In *CIB terminology* classes that are seen by client are called **proxy-classes** and the opaque pointer held by proxy-class is called **handle**. This is basically pimpl pattern (aka bridge pattern) with pimpl pointing to object across component boundary. **Note**: There is another kind of proxy class too, see Layout Sharing Proxy Class.
- Function ID is used as an index to fetch function pointer from **MethodTable**.
- Implementation of all functions including methods, constructors, and destructors of proxy classes are provided by means of invoking function pointer from MethodTable.

Above is only broad description of CIB architecture. For understanding each peice of CIB architecture please have a look at **examples** below. Each example tries to explain one peice of CIB architecture. Since this project is also about developing a tool that will automatically implement CIB architecture for a library the examples mentioned shows the code generated by CIB. Please be forewarned that little paitence will be required to analyse such code. :)

# About CIB project
This project is about creating a tool that implements CIB architecture. For detail explanation of architecture there are several examples. Examples are also automated tests. Each example tries to explain one part of architecture. To know the detail about how a particular feature works when CIB is used you can find the corresponding example. E.g. there is an example `runtime-polymorphism` to explain how polymorphism works across component boundary in ABI stable way. Each example contains two binary components. One is library and another is client which is an executable. In most cases it is sufficient to read `pub/example.h` and `src/example-client.cpp` files to understand what library exports and what client expects. Since these examples are also automated tests they can be run individually using ctest. For example `runtime-polymorphism` can be tested as:

```sh
ctest -R runtime-polymorphism
```

The output of above will be something like:

```
Test project /home/dassat/github/cib/builds
    Start 3: runtime-polymorphism_client
1/1 Test #3: runtime-polymorphism_client ......   Passed    0.01 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

There are examples that uses client of another example to show ABI stability when the library is changed. For example running:

```sh
ctest -R virtual-function-and-abi-stability
```

Will give following output:

```
Test project /home/dassat/github/cib/build
    Start 5: virtual-function-and-abi-stability_client
1/2 Test #5: virtual-function-and-abi-stability_client ....................   Passed    0.00 sec
    Start 6: virtual-function-and-abi-stability-new-lib-with-old-client
2/2 Test #6: virtual-function-and-abi-stability-new-lib-with-old-client ...   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

It ran 2 tests. First one tests that new client works as expected with new library. The second one tests that old client (without recompilation) works with newer library. For details about what change library made please have a look at corresponding `example.h` file.

Now we will delve into examples to know the details of CIB architecture.

!INCLUDE "examples/README.mdpp"

# Possible Optimization

## Layout Sharing Proxy Class
In a program there can be classes for which an isolated proxy class may not make too much sense. For example consider the following example:

!INCLUDECODE "examples/130-layout-sharing-proxy-classes/pub/example.h" (c++)

There is almost no chance that object layout of this class will change in future. Isolated proxy class is needed to completely isolate layout of objects used by library and client. The reason is that a future change in library can alter the object layout and will enforce clients to recompile if layouts are not isolated. For a class like `CPoint` defined above such chance is meager if not completely ruled out. So, library developer can take a call to dictate to CIB to create layout sharing proxy class instead of isolated proxy class. That has some benefits:
1. Memory is saved as layout is shared between client and library.
2. It is possible to share raw object array across component boundary which is not possible for isolated proxy objects.
 
But library developer, when decide to use layout sharing proxy class for a particular class, must be careful as they would, had it been a struct in a C library.

Please see example `layout-sharing-proxy-classes` for more detail.

# Limitations of CIB Architecture
CIB Architecture is good for ensuring ABI compatibility and stability. But unfortunately these goodness are not free. CIB architecture has limitations too:

| Limitation                                                  | Reason       | Workaround, if any |
| ---------------------------------                           | :----------  | :----------------- |
| Mandatory creation of proxy objects                         | The core philosophy of CIB is to not share internals with other components. For that reason each component have their own objects. The library objects used by client are used through proxies which are created at client side and act as if they are client side objects. So, for every library side object that client want to use, a corresponding proxy object is also created. It adds up to use of more memory and cost runtime performance too.                                                             | Use layout sharing proxy wherever applicable |
| Objects of library are always created on heap by the client | This is not true for layout sharing proxy classes but when client creates an object of isolated proxy object the corresponding object on library side is always created on heap.   | Use layout sharing proxy wherever applicable |
| Increased binary size and memory usage                      | Because of proxy objects and their special implementation using **MethodTable** binary size and memory usage of both library and client increases.                           | Use layout sharing proxy wherever applicable |
| Impact on runtime performance                               | CIB layers costs runtime performance too because there is no inline function across component, multiple function calls involved for a single call across component, and cross component function calls happen always through function pointer. | In practice these costs may not be significant. |
| No raw array of objects can cross component boundary in most cases | Except when the proxy class is layout sharing type it is not possible to share raw array of objects across component boundary.                                           | Return a container object instead or use layout sharing proxy wherever applicable. |
| In some cases explicit cleanup of proxy objects.            | Clients can only use library objects through proxies. And so when library returns an object which is not expected to be deleted then client will never delete the proxy object. Such object will be left without deletion and so they may need explicit cleanup. [See more on explicit proxy cleanup](#more-on-explicit-proxy-cleanup), and [Possible Improvement](#possible-improvement. | Use `shared_ptr`, or `unique_ptr`. Or, Use layout sharing proxy wherever applicable. |

## More on explicit proxy cleanup

The example of such cases can be 
- Singleton object whose creation and deletion is handled by library.
- Internal objects returned by library:
- A parameter of a callback invoked by library.

If the workaround mentioned above cannot be used then the only solution would be to explicitly delete those proxy objects using some special mechanism outside of regular program flow. Admittedly this will be dirty and so other solutions should be sought for, see [Possible Improvement](#possible-improvement).

# Possible Improvement
In the current implementation of CIB the association of library side object and proxy object is saved on the client side in a `map`. When a proxy object for a library side object is needed then unless there is no already existing proxy object available a new one is created. See example `proxy-object-reuse`.
CIB uses this implementation because the goal of CIB is to be minimally invasive, i.e. it doesn't want to change the way developer wants to define their classes. But if we can relax this restriction a little bit then the association between library side object and it's proxy objects can be stored in the library side object itself. The main benefit of this change will be to avoid the limitation where there is a need to explicitly clean the proxy objects. When a library side object is deleted then all associated proxy objects, if any, can be deleted too.

# Demo Project
For working demo see projects **graphics** and **draw** in `demo/functionality` folder.

**graphics** is the library that provides definition of various shape classes, like Circle, Rectangle, etc.
**draw** is the client of **graphics** that uses it to draw various shapes.
Folder **graphics/pub** contains files that graphics library wants to make public.

When **cib** is run, which is done as pre-build step, it creates files in **graphics/cib** and **graphics/exp**. These generated files use files in **graphics/pub** as input.
Files in **graphics/cib** are meant for **graphics** library to compile with.
Files in **graphics/exp** are part of SDK of library and meant for client of **graphics**, in this case **draw** project to compile with.

Build **draw** and run it. Make changes in headers of **graphics** and build just **graphics_cibified** and run **draw_cibified**. Observe that non-breaking changes listed above don't make **graphics_cibified** and **draw_cibified** incompatible. But those changes make **graphics** and **draw** (the binaries that don't use CIB) incompatible.

# Feature Progress of CIB tool

| Feature                                   | Description | Status |
| ---------------------------------         | :---------- | :----- |
| Basic                                     | CIB should work for a simple library that exports classes with non-virtual functions. | Done |
| Virtual functions and inheritance         | CIB should make virtual function and inheritance available to clients. | Done |
| Function overloading                      | Same named functions of a class should be seamlessly exported. | Done |
| Function overridding                      | Allow library to use interface implemented by client. | Done |
| Forward compatibility of client           | Older client works with newer library. | Done |
| Forward compatibility of library          | Library should be ABI compatible with newer client. As of now library and client can catch exception when non existing function is called and should take corrective measures to work with newer component. | Done |
| Backward compatibility of client          | When newer client invokes a method present only in new SDK then std::bad\_function\_call exception will be thrown. Clients that want to be backward compatible should handle this exception when invoking methods present only in newer SDK. | Done |
| Backward compatibility of library         | When library invokes a method of interface implemented by only newer client then std::bad\_function\_call exception will be thrown. Library developer should be aware about this to remain backward compatible when invoking new methods of it's own public interface. | Done   |
| Create correct proxy class                | A base class pointer returned by an API of library may actually be pointing to an object of a derived class. At client side we should create proxy class of exact same type to which the returned pointer is pointing to. It is needed so that dynamic_cast at client side should work as expected. | Done |
| Operator overloading                      | It is common for C++ classes to have overloaded operators. | Done |
| Typecast operator overloading             | Typecast operator overloading of user defined types is common in C++. | Done |
| Simple Template class support             | Support for simple template classes when it crosses component boundary. Simple template means without template template argument, or any of other fancy stuff. | Done|
| Return existing proxy class               | If a function returns pointer or reference of object for which proxy class already exists then existing proxy class should be returned. | Done|
| Support protected methods                 | Protected methods are accessible to derived class and they should be exported so that client's derived class can call them. | Done|
| Support private pure virtual              | Private pure virtual is used in template method design pattern. | Done|
| Rvalue reference parameter                | RValue references need to cross component boundary. | Done|
| Support of free functions                 | Free functions in global and orher namespaces too should be supported. | Done |
| **Goal**: Use CIB in real production SDK  | To demonstrably prove viability of this architecture and tool it will be better to use it for at least one large production quality software. My plan is to use CIB for ObjectARX SDK of AutoCAD to demonstrate it's viability. | **IN PROGRESS** |
| **Phase1**: For AutoCAD SDK subset        | Make CIB work for ObjectARX SDK even when it requires changing of SDK headers to avoid problems of SDK and/or the tool. | **DONE** |
| **Phase2**: For complete AutoCAD SDK      | Improve tool so that only minimal change in ObjectARX SDK is required and that too only to avoid problems of SDK and not of tool. | **IN PROGRESS** |
| Support deleted members                   | Constructors and operators marked as `delete` should be deleted for proxy classes as well. ||
| Enum and enum classes                     | Enums used as parameter or return type. |
| STL classes                               | It is common for a C++ programs to use stl classes. CIB should make it possible to export STL classes in the same way it does for every other classes. |
| Support shared_ptr and unique_ptr         | Modern C++ programing expects these to be used more often. |
| Exception support                         | Make exception object travel across component boundary in a compatible way. |
| Function pointer as parameter             | Function pointers can be used as parameter or return type of another function. ||
| Support std::function                     | std::function can be used as function parameter or return type. They too should be supported. ||
| Support for intrusive pointer             | Many libraries use intrusive pointer to manage object life cyle and functions can return smart pointer for intrusively managed reference count of object. |
| Non-const pointer ref return type         | When a reference of pointer of non-POD is returned from a function a change in that should be propagated to the library.|
| Support public data members               | Public data members of a class should be exported in ABI stable way. |

# CIB Terminology
## Inline Class
A class that has all methods inline. *For example a template class is surely an inline class*.
## Shared Class
A C++ class whose intances cross component boundary: *When a class is not an inline class or there exists a public function that returns or takes an object/pointer/reference of a C++ class then such class is called a shared class*.
## Facade Class
A C++ class that acts as facade for other classes: *A class that has public virtual method and there exists public function/method that returns a pointer/reference of this class*. Since the returned object can actually be a type of any of derived class the return type acts as facade for all it's derived classes.
## Interface Class
A C++ class that has public virtual method and there exists a way for library to call methods of an object of class defined by client.
*A simplest example can be that when a C++ class that has public virtual method is used as pointer or reference parameter of a function*.
## Proxy Class
For each public class of a library CIB produces another class with same name and behaviour. Such client usable classes are called proxy classes because they act as a proxy of original class to the client. There are 2 kinds of proxy classes:
  1. Isolated proxy class, aka bridge proxy class.
  2. Layout sharing proxy class. Both original and proxy class share same object layout.

**Note**: When simply `proxy class` is used then it always means `isolated proxy class`.
## Handle
Each isolated proxy class instance owns opaque pointer of the original class. Such opaque pointer are called handle.

# Implementation Details
## Parsing Technique
We use cppparser to parse C++ headers. Clang can be an option but since we do not need full and complete compiler level type resolution clang is not suitable for us. For example if a function is declared as:

`
void ExampleFunction(wxInt32 i);
`

cib doesn't need to resolve wxInt32. In-fact if it resolves it completely then it will be a problem because wxInt32 can be an **int**, or a **long** depending upon platform and cib really should produce same definitions on all platforms. The idea of cib is that it should produce same headers for all platforms so that it can be used to publish SDK because different headers for different platforms don't sound like a good idea.

## Creating proxy class from handle
When a function returns pointer to base class then it is necessary to create instance of proxy class which represents exact same class that the returned pointer is pointing to. For example if a function return type is Shape* and when invoked it actually returns pointer to a Rectangle instance. On client side we will need to create instance of Rectangle proxy class instead of Shape proxy class. It is to be noted that it has to be done only for facade classes for other classes there is no need for this.

**TODO**: Add more details.
